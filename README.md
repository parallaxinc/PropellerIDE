============

PropellerIDE is an easy-to-use, cross-platform development tool for the Parallax Propeller microcontroller.

Write Spin code, download programs to your Propeller board, and debug your applications with the built-in serial terminal.

PropellerIDE is written in C++ with Qt.

## Project Roadmap

#### Immediate focus

* Improve overall code maintainability
* Refactor components for better separation of concerns
* Refactor widgets to use UI forms
* Auto-select newly attached serial devices

#### Long-term focus

* Translation support

* Serial and wireless code download
* New platforms: Android, ChromeBook, HTML5, iOS
 
#### Requested features (short list)

* PropTool-style View Info widget
* Alt-Drag to select text blocks
* Colorful serial console formatting
* Indent guides
* More Propeller documentation

#### Features to support LameStation

## Building

### Dependencies

* PropellerIDE requires at least Qt5.2.
* Windows packaging requires Inno Setup 5 with preprocessor support. 
* Build and release tools require Python 2.7.

### Targets

Type `make help` to see a list of available package targets.

```
$ make help
Usage:    make [TYPE]

Enter target type to build. Options:

   checkout     initialize child repositories

   win          windows installer
   mac          mac bundle
   deb          debian package
   rpi          debian package for Raspberry Pi

   no parameter builds only the binaries
```

### Linux

Run an update to ensure your apt repositories are up-to-date.

```
sudo apt-get update
```

Install the required dependencies.

```
sudo apt-get install git make g++ qt5-default zlib1g-dev
```

Checkout the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/lamestation/PropellerIDE.git PropellerIDE
cd PropellerIDE
```

Type `make deb` in the project root to build a Debian package.

```
make deb
```

Type `make clean` to remove old build files.

```
make clean
```

PropellerIDE is known to build on Ubuntu as far back as 12.04.

### Windows

PropellerIDE on Windows is built using the Qt5 MinGW distribution from Qt's website:

* http://qt-project.org/downloads

For development, the easiest way to get started building the project is through QtCreator. Open the `src/src.pro` file as a project in the editor and build. Shadowed builds are not currently supported.

PropellerIDE can also be built from the Windows PowerShell. This is how release builds and installers are produced. You will need to set the system path correctly.

```
C:\Qt\Tools\mingw482_32\bin;C:\Qt\5.3\mingw482_32\bin;C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 5
```

Open the PowerShell. The `make` command on Windows is `mingw32-make.exe`. Add the `win` parameter to build a Windows installer.

```
mingw32-make.exe win
```

PropellerIDE has been built on Windows 7 and 8.

*Note: QtCreator and command-line builds generate build files that are incompatible with each other, so you will need to call `make distclean` in the `src/` directory before you can switch from one to the other.*

### OS X

Install XCode through the App Store, then install the command-line tools through the terminal.

```
xcode-select --install
```

Type `make mac` to create an app bundle and DMG package for distribution.

```
make mac
```

The Qt version used must match the XCode version. The easiest solution is to use the latest version of xcode and Qt.

### Raspberry Pi - Raspbian Wheezy

Qt5 is not available in the standard repository, but you can obtain it from Debian backports.

Add the following entries to `/etc/apt/sources.list`.

```
deb http://twolife.be/raspbian/ wheezy main backports
deb-src http://twolife.be/raspbian/ wheezy main backports
```

Add the repository key.

```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key 2578B775
```

Update and install Qt5 and its dependencies.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qt5-default qt5-qmake libegl1-mesa libgles2-mesa
```

Finally, use the build the `rpi` target to create a Debian package for Raspberry Pi.

```
make rpi
```

## Cleaning

Use the `clean` on all platforms to clean up old build files.

## Installing

All build targets output packages in the `staging/` directory.


And install:

```
sudo dpkg -i staging/*armhf.deb
```
